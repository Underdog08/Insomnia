Insomnia is a Minecraft zombie\-apocalypse\-type mod that is currently under development. It aims to recreate the game from the ground up by reshaping the entire progression system into something more difficult and nightmarish. Here is what the mod consists of so far:
***

# WORLD CHANGES:

* All biomes other than the Forest, River, and Ocean have been removed, along with the majority of the structures found within them.

* No mobs will spawn in the world other than Zombies, Husks, Zombie Villagers, and rarely a Cow, Pig, or Sheep. (Squids spawn in bodies of water)

* Time does not advance, and it is always midnight.

* Villages have been added to the Forests, but are always zombie villages.

* A few custom structures have been added to the world to break up the "sameness" but will not contain any major loot.

* A few features have been added to the Forests such as patches of wither roses and mossy cobblestone clumps on the ground.

# PROGRESSION CHANGES:

When you start any normal Minecraft world, your first instinct is to mine a tree. This, however, is not the case in this mod. Instead, you will be required to break leaves and gravel in hopes of finding a stick and flint. Using these items, you can craft a flint axe, which will allow you to mine barely enough wood to make a crafting table and a wood axe.

Using your wood axe, you will be able to mine more wood and make some basic wooden tools. After this, however, you will want to craft a campfire, and then crafting that into a furnace along with some cobblestone.

After you have a furnace, you will be able to smelt cobblestone into normal stone, which can then be crafted into stone tools. Your stone tools will be sufficient enough to mine some iron and coal, allowing you to get your first bits of iron.

Iron tools will then allow you to mine diamonds, and at that point you have pretty much completed progression. There are some other objectives to go for in the form of advancements, but as of right now obtaining diamonds is the main objective.

# ADDED CONTENT:

Two new status effects have been added, being Fatigue and Infected...

* The Fatigue effect reduces your health to 5 hearts and slows your mining speed significantly. It is constantly applied to the player while they are in survival mode.

* The Infected effect is arguably the more interesting of the two. When any zombie hits you, it has a 1/8 chance to inflict the Infected effect for anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes. When the timer runs out, you will die. You can, however, eat a golden apple to cure yourself of the effect, and milk will remove all effects EXCEPT this one.

A few new items have been added as well, and they are as follows:

* Matchsticks - Matchsticks are crafted with 2 sticks and function similarly to flint and steel, except they only have a slight chance to ignite, and will break after 5 uses. Their main use is in crafting a campfire.

* Plant Fibers - Plant Fibers are obtained by breaking grass, and will drop rarely no matter what tool is used. They have no functional use aside from being a crafting component.

* Flint Axe - The Flint Axe is crafted with a stick and flint and is the first tool available to the player. It has 10 durability and is only used as a means of gathering the first few logs.


*Note: All recipes and advancements in vanilla Minecraft have been removed, and thus items that exist in the base game may not necessarily be obtainable anymore. This is intentional, as forcing progression is more effective if you eliminate all workarounds beforehand.*
